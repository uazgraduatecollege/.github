## UArizona Graduate Collete Web Technologies

We are the Graduate College Information Technology department's Web Technologies Team, and we build web applications and web sites serving a broad audience, from prospective and continuing students, to faculty and staff, to community members both local and global.

The Graduate College provides central support and leadership to serve, oversee, and advance all aspects of the graduate enterprise at the University of Arizona, and it provides a foundation for excellence for students pursuing graduate degrees in more than one hundred different fields at one of the top academic institutions in the country.

The Web Team supports the administrative and service goals of the Graduate College and the Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs (GIDP) home office.
